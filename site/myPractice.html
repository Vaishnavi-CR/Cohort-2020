	<p>P tag is a paragraph tag. In a Seahawks season that often defied convention, maybe it makes sense that a team with one of the best home-field advantages in the NFL over the last two decades suddenly did better on the road.

The Seahawks won a franchise-record seven road games this season, losing just once, compared to a 4-4 mark at CenturyLink Field, where they are 99-45 since it opened in 2002. Thatâ€™s better than any team in the NFL other than Green Bay (which is 101-41-2 at Lambeau Field in that span).

<span>**This is the span tag after a P tag </span>
<div>**This is the first DIV tag</div>
<div>**This is the second DIV tag</div>
<span>**This is the SPAN tag and this line is a continuation to second DIV tag because DIV tag naturally creates a line break before and after it</span>
<div>**This is the third DIV tag following a SPAN but displays in a new line
<span>This is a SPAN tag inside DIV3 and displays in continuation to DIV3</span></div>
